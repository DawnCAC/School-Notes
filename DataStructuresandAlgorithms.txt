Chapter 1: Getting Started
1.1
	* Covers fundamentals of dynamic data structures
	* Python software is the bases
	* Covers object-oriented design and abstract data types as a design paradigm
1.2
	* Python Code Commenting Style Requirements
	* For inline comments use # and a space, then add your comment 
	* # and a space can be used for multi-line comments by putting them at the front of each line
	* Last is using 3 quote marks “”” on each side of the quote.  These are usually for describing what a piece of code does.
	* Use a style guide to help guide your code style
